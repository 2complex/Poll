# Poll

A self hostet custom polling service.

This service consists of several components (some of these are not in this repository and can be
replaced with any service that supports the required features):

- The UI for Web Browser (Desktop and Mobile)
- Backend Server (inside Docker)
- Database (inside Docker compose)
- OpenID server for authentification (not included, in my releases I will use keycloak)
- Email Server (not included)
